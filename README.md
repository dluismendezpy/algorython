## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- The `algorithms` folder contains separate files for each algorithm.

- The `main.py` file at the root of the project is responsible for calling each of the algorithms.

## How to Use

- Clone the project repository to your local machine.
- Open project in your code editor or IDE.
- Run the main file to run the algorithms.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to the project, you can add new algorithms to the algorithms folder. Make sure to follow the
same structure and format used in the existing files. Also make sure to update the main file to call your new algorithm.
